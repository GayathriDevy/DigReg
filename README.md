# DIGIT RECOGNITION WITH MULTI-LAYER PERCEPTRON
# Overview
- This project aims to implement a digit recognition system using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network.
- The objective is to build a model capable of accurately classifying handwritten digits (0-9) based on pixel values.
# Dataset
- The dataset used in this project is the train.csv and test.csv dataset, a widely-used benchmark dataset for handwritten digit recognition tasks.
- It comprises images of handwritten digits along with their corresponding labels. ##The dataset contains both the training images as well as test images.
- You can access the train and test dataset through pandas,numpy,and to visualize it use the matplotlib.
## Model Used
- The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier is a fundamental neural network architecture widely used in machine learning for classification tasks.
-  Comprising multiple layers of nodes, including an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer, MLPs can learn complex patterns and relationships within data.
-  The MLP adjusts its weights to minimize prediction errors during training.
-  Import the model MLPClassifier using the sklearn.neural_network
## Motive
- Project helps to identify the digits by giving some unshaped images as input and the model will predict the desired number.
- The main DigitalRecognition.ipynb file and the dataset train.csv and test.csv along with presentation has been uploaded.
